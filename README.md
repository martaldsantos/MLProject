# Personal Projects

This Github repository showcases a collection of personal coding projects that I have worked on in the past. These projects demonstrate my skills and experience in Python (either with Ipython Notebooks or .py files), and follow under the domains of supervised and unsupervised learning, computer vision, etc.

Each project comes with a detailed description of its purpose, features, and implementation and some of them come with a requirements.txt file for dependencies. Whether you're a recruiter, a potential employer, or a fellow developer, I hope you'll find these projects interesting and an informative way to showcase some of the kinds of projects I'm comfortable working on.

Most of these projects were started during the Master's Degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics as a team with my colleagues Gustavo Brito and Miguel Mateus, who are also owners of this repo.
