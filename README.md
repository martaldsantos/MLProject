# Personal Projects
This Github repository showcases a collection of personal coding projects that I have worked on in the past. These projects demonstrate my skills and experience in Python (either with Ipython Notebooks or .py files), and are structured as projects on Regression, Classification, Text Mining, Computer Vision and Optimization Algorithms. Each project comes with a detailed description of its purpose, features, and implementation. Whether you're a recruiter, a potential employer, or a fellow developer, I hope you'll find these projects interesting and informative.
